Firing Squad Synchronization Problem

Jean Duprat (LIP, ENS Lyon), July 1997

The firing squad synchronization problem was introduced by Moore in 1962.
One considers a finite -but arbitrarily long- ordered line of n
finite-state machines. At time O, the leftest one is distinguished
(general) from the others ones (soldiers).These machines work
synchronously; the state of a machine number i at time t+1 depends only of
the states at time t of the machines number i-1, i and i+1.
The problem is to define finite sets of states and transition rules so that
all machines enter for the first time a distinguished state (fire) at the
very same moment.
Jacques Mazoyer (LIP-ENS Lyon) has given a six-state minimal time solution
in may 86 (TCS 50, pp 183-238). It is the proof that this solution is
correct which is implemented here in COQ. The machine is described in the
module autom and the last theorem (named firing squad) is in the module
final.
